#Mob programming

## Purpose

This mob-programming application was created by 4 students in the 2nd year of software engineering within the AEN group, more precisely on the Nîmes campus.

PACK Solutions uses the agile methodology within its company. This is why PACK Solutions asks these 4 students to create a mob programming application in order to be able to hold meetings with this tool remotely.
